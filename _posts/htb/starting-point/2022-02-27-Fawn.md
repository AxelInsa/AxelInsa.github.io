# [](#header-4)Connection

In this case we need to make a connection with ftp. We will use the **anonymous** user to connect, with no password.
{% highlight plain %}
$ ftp 10.129.1.14
Name (10.129.1.14:kali): anonymous
Password:
{% endhighlight %}

# [](#header-4)Flag

With **get**, we can download the file.
{% highlight plain %}
ftp> ls
ftp> get flag.txt
ftp> exit

$ cat flag.txt
{% endhighlight %}
