# Appointment
## Connection
We can search the IP in the navbar to get a website.
![login](../../../img/htb/starting-point/Screenshot_1.jpg)

We will try a basic sql-injection, login with the user:
{% highlight bash %}
' or '1'='1' #
{% endhighlight %}
For the password we just need to write a letter.

## Flag
The flag will be in front of us.

# Sequel
## Connection
We will use mysql to connect, with the **root** user.
{% highlight bash %}
> mysql -u root -h 10.129.220.35
{% endhighlight %}

## Flag
Now we are in, we just need to list all the databases and search for the flag.
{% highlight mysql %}
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| htb                |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
MariaDB [(none)]> use htb;

MariaDB [htb]> show tables;
+---------------+
| Tables_in_htb |
+---------------+

# Crocodile
## Connection
We will connect with ftp and the user **anonymous**. There we can download two files, with users and passwords.
{% highlight bash %}
> ftp 10.129.122.93
{% endhighlight %}
With **gobuster** we can check for others files in the webpage, and we can see a **login.php**:
{% highlight bash %}
>  gobuster dir -u http://10.129.122.93/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php
{% endhighlight %}

## Flag
We will have now this page:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeropio/zeropio.github.io/main/_posts/htb/starting-point/img/Screenshot_2.jpg" weight="100%" />
With the **admin** login we can enter and get our flag.
