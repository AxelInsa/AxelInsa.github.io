# Basic Access
We can try login using the **anonymous** user by default (with no password):
{% highlight bash %}
> ssh anonymous@ip
    Enter password:
anonymous@ip#  
{% endhighlight %}

# RSA file
If we manage to get the rsa file we can connect with:
{% highlight bash %}
> chmod 600 id_rsa
> ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
{% endhighlight %}
