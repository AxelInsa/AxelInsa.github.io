# SSH

## Basic Access
We can try login using the **anonymous** user by default (with no password):
```console
$ ssh anonymous@ip
    Enter password:
anonymous@ip#  
```

## RSA file
If we manage to get the rsa file we can connect with:
```console
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
$ ssh -i id_rsa user@ip
```

# FTP 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an Application Layer protocol that enables quick data transfer between computing devices. 

To perform a basic connection to a FTP:

```console
zero@pio$ ftp <ip>
```

We can download all the aviables file in a system with:
```console
zero@pio$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<IP>
```

With the **PUT** command, we can upload files in the current folder to the FTP server:
```console
ftp> put <FILE>
```

Inside, basic commands can be use:

| **Command**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `ls`   | List files and folders   |
| `cd`   | Change directory   |
| `get <file>`   | Download file in our machine   |
| `exit`   | Exit the FTP   |

A full command list [here](https://www.smartfile.com/blog/the-ultimate-ftp-commands-list/), with a list of the status [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes).

# Samba

**SMB** (Server Message Block) is a prevalent protocol on Windows machines that provides many vectors for vertical and lateral movement. Some versions can be vulnerable to **EternalBlue**.

To check the Samba with Nmap:

```console
zero@pio$ nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p<port> <ip>
```

## Connection

Samba share folders and files. We can try connecting to it with **smbclient**.

First, we need to list all the aviable folders:

```console
zero@pio$ smbclient -N -L \\\\<ip>

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        users           Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (gs-svcscan server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

| **Flag**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `-N`   | No password   |
| `-L`   | List |

Then we can perform a connection:

```console
zero@pio$ smbclient \\\\<ip>\\<folder>
 smb: \>
```

To connect as a user:

```console
zero@pio$ smbclient -U <user> \\\\<ip>\\<folder>
```

## Commands

| **Command**   | **Description**    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| `ls`   | List files and folders   |
| `cd`   | Change directory   |
| `get <file>`   | Download file in our machine   |
| `exit`   | Exit   |

# RDP 
RDP is a proprietary Microsoft protocol which allows a user to connect to a remote system over a network connection and obtain a graphical user interface. RDP uses port 3389.

To perform a connection to a RDP:
```console
zero@pio$ xfreerdp /v:<ip> /u:<user> /p:<password>
```
