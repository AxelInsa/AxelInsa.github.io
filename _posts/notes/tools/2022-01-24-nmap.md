# Basic
The more common options are:
- **-sS**: do a stealth scan with TCP SYN
- **-sU**: UDP scan
- **-O**: detect the OS
- **-sV**: provides services version
- **-v** and **-vv**: increase the verbosity
- **-Pn**: do not use ping
- **-oN**: export the scan in a file
- **-oA**: export the scan three major formats
- **-A**: aggresive scan
- **-p-**: scan **all** the ports


# Windows
Because of many Windows machines slower the enumeration we can modify the scan:
```console
$ nmap --min-rate 500 --open -vvv 192.168.0.1 -oN file
```

Let's see each one:
- **--min-rate** limit the size of the packets send to increase speed
- **--open** show only open ports
- **-vvv** verbose, so we can see the ports that have been descovering while the process.
