# Basic
- **-sS** do a stealth scan with TCP SYN
- **-Pn** do not use ping
- **-oN** export the scan in a file


# Windows
Because of many Windows machines slower the enumeration we can modify the scan:
{% highlight bash %}
> nmap --min-rate 500 --open -vvv 192.168.0.1 -oN file
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see each one:
- **--min-rate** limit the size of the packets send to increase speed
- **--open** show only open ports
- **-vvv** verbose, so we can see the ports that have been descovering while the process.
