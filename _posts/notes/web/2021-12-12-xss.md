# [](#header-4)Cross-site script

If we have a form we can try to insert code, like this:
{% highlight plain %}
<script> ... </script>
{% endhighlight %}
If the page execute what are in the form we can make several damage to the page.

There are some examples:
{% highlight plain %}
<script> window.location="" </script>
{% endhighlight %}
This will send the target to a different page (phishing).

{% highlight plain %}
<script> alert(document.cookie) </script>
{% endhighlight %}
This will show the user's cookie, it can be send to the intruder. It will lead to a session hijacking.

Also, if we use **deface** we can send a visitor to another part of the webpage. This can break the whole page.
