# CSRF
**CSRF** is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.

We can test it with **Burp**. First we need to find a request to the server with **POST**. Send that to the intercept from Burp, and then to the intruder.
You should be able to see te request, right-click and change the method (from POST to GET). If you get an url with the form, you have found the CSRF.

# SSRF
In a **SSRF** the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources.

First we need to find a place were the webpage is printing a file from the server. If we can manipulate that data we can enumarete the machine.
We can do a fuzzer to list the ports, for example, with Burp.
