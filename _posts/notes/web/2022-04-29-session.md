# Dictionary login
We can use **crunch** to create a dictionary:
```html
$ crunch 6 8 abc12 -o dict.txt
```
- **6**: minimum character
- **8**: maximum character
- **abc12**: allowed character

We can use the option **-t** to create patrons:
```html
$ crunch 6 6 abc12 -o dict.txt -t a@@@@b
```
This will make the **a** and **b** at the beginning and end respectively.
