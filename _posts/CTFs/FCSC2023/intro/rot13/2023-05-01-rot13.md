Here is the context:

We have a text that is encoded with rot13. We can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode it:

We've got the flag: FCSC{ed24c7fd86c2f0515366}

This challenge was very easy, but it was a good warm-up for the next ones. It's an introduction to encoding/decoding.
