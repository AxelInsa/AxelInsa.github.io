## Context

![context](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/osint/le_tour_de_france/context.png)

We are given this image:

We have to find the location of the panel.

## Resolution

It seems that we are at a freeway exit. On the right panel we can see that we are going to the A6 freeway and on the left panel to the A5 freeway. I searched a lot to find the location using these two informations and the directions on the panels.

Then I realised I could use the E17 E21 information because it's european routes.

This what I get by searching it:

Looking at the url, we can retrieve the coordinates needed to create the flag.
