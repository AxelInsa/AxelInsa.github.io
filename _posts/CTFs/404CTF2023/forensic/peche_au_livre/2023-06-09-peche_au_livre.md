## Context

![context](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/forensic/peche_au_livre/context.png)

We are given a network packet capture, let's open it with Wireshark.

There are 5 TCP conversations on port 80, It must be a web server:

![conversations](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/forensic/peche_au_livre/conversations.png)


Looking at the Protocol Hierarchy, we can confirm that HTTP is used:

![protocols](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/forensic/peche_au_livre/protocols.png)

Looking at the conversations (Follow TCP stream), we can see that several images are transfered from the server to the client.

Let's download them (File > Export Objects > HTTP).

Let's take a look at them:

We've got the flag ðŸŽ‰ !!

We can use an online OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to retrieve the flag:

```404CTF{345Y_W1r35h4rK}```
