Here is the context:

![context](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/context.png)


The goal is to read the ddfc.

By clicking the link, we end up on this page:

![home](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/home.png)

The page contains a link to this URL:

```
https://ddfc.challenges.404ctf.fr/ddfc?expiry=-5625891076&signature=wawF6dC4Hz9g5NyCc3j1KCDcfztFE/sp
```

This is the page we obtain:

![expired](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/expired.png)

The link is expired. As the title mentionned, the link is supposed to be valid a week. Here the time stamp indicate the date 21 september 1791:

![date](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/date.png)

We need to find a way to modify the expiry parameter in the URL.

After a lot of struggling, trying to understand how the signature is formed, I thought that we could do parameter pollution.

So, I tried to add an expiry parameter:

```
https://ddfc.challenges.404ctf.fr/ddfc?expiry=-5625891076&signature=wawF6dC4Hz9g5NyCc3j1KCDcfztFE/sp&expiry=
```

I get this page:

![missing](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/missing.png)

It looks like the second expiry parameter is used instead of the first one. Does it validate the signature though?

I tried to add a big positive value as expiry parameter:

```
https://ddfc.challenges.404ctf.fr/ddfc?expiry=-5625891076&signature=wawF6dC4Hz9g5NyCc3j1KCDcfztFE/sp&expiry=5625891076
```

![ddfc](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/ddfc.png)

We get the page ðŸŽ‰ !

We can find the flag at the bottom of the page:

![flag](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web/fuite_en_1791/flag.png)

I hope you enjoyed this challenge !
