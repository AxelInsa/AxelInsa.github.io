## Context

![context](/assets/img/CTFs/404CTF2023/web3/art/context.png)

We have to find the artist' address Ethereum.

## Resolution

I used [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) website to find the artwork.

I searched for "blanc avec des liser√©s blancs transversaux" that seems to be the name of the NFT bought.

These are the first results:

The single color NFTs belongs are owned by Antrios who the artist mentionned in the initial statement.

On his profile, we get his Ethereum address.

The flag is 404CTF{0xD7186D588Ed2AddF8b260d09B108100f264A64A9}
