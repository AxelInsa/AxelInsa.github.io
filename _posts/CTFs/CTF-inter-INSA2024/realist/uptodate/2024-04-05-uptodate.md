Let's run nmap on the target:

![nmap](/assets/img/CTFs/CTF-inter-INSA2024/realist/uptodate/nmap.png)

There is one open port:
* 80 -> website

The website is running drupal which is an open source CMS.

We can find out the version of the CMS:

I found an exploit on github to get a web shell.

I used it to launch a reverse shell with a reverse shell. I used ngrok and netcat as listeners. Then I stabilized the shell.

In the /home/debian directory, we get the user flag.

After searching for 1 hour, I found out that the password of debian is "debian" ðŸ˜….

The user www-data can execute /home/debian/ping.py with sudo.

![sudo_l_debian](/assets/img/CTFs/CTF-inter-INSA2024/realist/uptodate/sudo_l_debian.png)

The ping.py script import the requests library. Since we control the debian home folder, we can create a requests.py folder to library hijacking.

We create a requests.py scripts in /home/debian

```python
import os

os.system("/bin/bash")
```

We get back to the www-data session and run sudo /home/debian/ping.py

We get a root shell and the flag
