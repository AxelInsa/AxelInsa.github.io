Let's run nmap on the target:

![nmap](/assets/img/CTFs/CTF-inter-INSA2024/realist/admin_files/nmap.png)

There are 2 ports open:
* 22 -> ssh
* 80 -> website

On the web site is run with the elfinder software which is an open-source file manager for web.

There is one file on the website named CredsE.txt which contains credentials encoded with ROT.

We decode it with Cyberchef and get the debian credentials:

We connect as debian and get the user flag.

debian can /usr/bin/python with sudo permissions so the privesc is quite easy.

![root_flag](/assets/img/CTFs/CTF-inter-INSA2024/realist/admin_files/root_flag.png)

We've got the root flag ðŸŽ‰
